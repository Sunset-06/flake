This is a Chip 8 interpreter written in C.

The file structure might be a bit messy as of now, but all the functionss and variables are declared in one header file, so they should be easy to keep track of.

## How to get it to work (for now)
Compile the four files in the src directory. Once done, pass the path to the rom as an argument when running the program.
For Example:
```bash

```
